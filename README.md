# Wild Galois Representations
 In this repository I include the Magma functions that compute the Galois representation attached to an elliptic curve with non abelian inertia image, or a hyperelliptic curve of the form y^2=f(x), where f is a polynomial of degree p over a p-adic field, with maximal inertia image.
